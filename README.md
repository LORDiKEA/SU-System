# SU-System
Written for my school to manage detailed information of student activities.
I haven't shown this to my high school yet. I plan to tell them my ideas and this project when all basic functions have been tested.

One thing to keep in mind: **This project is still in development. Only basic features have been added. Please use it only if you understand what you are doing.**

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/waymao/SU-System.git
cd SU-System
pip install django django-bootstrap3 django-bootstrap3-datetimepicker
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
Tested using Python 3 on mac os and linux.
